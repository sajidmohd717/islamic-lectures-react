# React Project

Will be restarting this project, once you combine every stack in 
MERN stack, you realize, you kinda can make your code more efficient and cleaner
since i was only using react all this time, the structure of my code is totally messed up
apart from that, when i restart, i can brush up on my react skills, i thought my react was good
but it's actually jack shit
